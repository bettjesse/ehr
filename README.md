Table Reservation is a web-based application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). It provides clients with the ability to reserve tables at restaurants and manage their reservations.

With this application, users can easily make table reservations, view their existing reservations, and update or cancel reservations as needed.

The project leverages the MERN stack to create a seamless user experience, with React handling the frontend interface, Express serving as the backend framework, MongoDB for data storage, and Node.js for server-side functionality.

By utilizing this application, clients can streamline the process of reserving tables at their favorite restaurants, enhancing their dining experiences.
